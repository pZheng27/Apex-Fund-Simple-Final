# Background and Motivation
The current implementation uses localStorage for storing coin assets, which means:
1. Data is only stored locally on each user's browser
2. Changes made by one user are not visible to others
3. Data is lost when users clear their browser data

We need to implement a proper backend solution to:
1. Persist data across all users
2. Enable real-time updates when assets are added/modified
3. Ensure data consistency and reliability

# Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Backend Selection:
   - Need a database that supports real-time updates
   - Should be easy to deploy and maintain
   - Must be cost-effective for the scale of the application
   - Supabase provides PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
   - Supabase Storage for image handling
   - Built-in authentication and security

2. Implementation Considerations:
   - Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing code
   - Must handle image storage efficiently
   - Should implement proper error handling and data validation
   - Need to consider security and access control
   - Need to set up proper database schema and relationships

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Real-time updates should be efficient
   - Image handling should be optimized
   - Database queries should be optimized
   - Need to implement proper indexing for queries

# High-level Task Breakdown
1. Set up Supabase Backend
   - Create Supabase project
   - Set up PostgreSQL database
   - Configure database schema
   - Set up Supabase Storage for images
   - Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies

2. Implement Supabase Integration
   - Create Supabase configuration
   - Implement database CRUD operations
   - Set up real-time subscriptions
   - Implement image upload to Supabase Storage
   - Set up proper error handling

3. Update Frontend Components
   - Modify coinService.ts to use Supabase
   - Update DashboardContent.tsx for real-time updates
   - Update CoinsList.tsx for better error handling
   - Add loading states and error messages
   - Implement proper TypeScript types for database schema

4. Testing and Deployment
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify real-time updates work
   - Test image upload and retrieval
   - Test security policies
   - Deploy to production
